# Mii Creator WASM

This is a wrapper for FFL for WebAssembly, specifically for usage in Mii Creator.

> ⚠️ You will need to build FFL for WebAssembly first. This library does not build off of FFL's source directly, but links it statically.

I decided to wipe this README since I keep changing the function names and how they should work.

I will add true documentation never.
