# Mii Creator WASM

This is a wrapper for FFL for WebAssembly, specifically for usage in Mii Creator.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please manually add `ffl`, `rio` and `ninTexUtils` to the `lib` folder.
> RIO cannot be built directly from source, you must add `GLESV3/gl3.h` header to RIO_GL.h.
 
> üìù I installed ZLIB from vcpkg. You can build it from scratch if you'd like, it doesn't matter. As long as ZLIB is available.

I decided to wipe this README since I keep changing the function names and how they should work.

I will add true documentation never.

## TODO:

 - Add option to bind specific WebGL texture handles to render targets
 - Add mesh exporting
 - Profit???
